    """
    Finds the smallest bounding rectangle for a set of points in two dimensional space.
    Returns a set of points (in clockwise order) representing the corners of the bounding box.

    Algorithm high level idea:
        One edge of the minimum bounding rectangle for a set of points will be the same as one of the edges of the
        convex hull of those points.

    Algorithm:
     1. Create a convex hull (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) of the input points.
     2. Calculate the angles that all the edges of the convex hull make with the x-axis. Assume that there are N unique
        angles calculated in this step.
     3. Create rotation matrices for all the N unique angles computed in step 2.
     4. Create N set of convex hull points by rotating the original convex hull points using all the N rotation matrices
        computed in the last step.
     5. For each of the N set of convex hull points computed in the last step, calculate the bounding rectangle by
        calculating (min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y).
     6. For the N bounding rectangles computed in the last step, find the rectangle with the minimum area. This will
        give the minimum bounding rectangle for our rotated set of convex hull points (see Step 4).
     7. Undo the rotation of the convex hull by multiplying the points with the inverse of the rotation matrix. And
        remember that the inverse of a rotation matrix is equal to the transpose of the rotation matrix. The returned
        points are in a clockwise order.

    To visualize what this function does, you can use the following snippet:

    for n in range(10):
        points = np.random.rand(8,2)
        plt.scatter(points[:,0], points[:,1])
        bbox = minimum_bounding_rectangle(points)
