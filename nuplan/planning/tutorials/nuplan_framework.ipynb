    "\n",
    "It provides a high quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data from 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic patterns (Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore). In addition, it provides a closed-loop simulation framework with reactive agents, a training platform as well as a large set of both general and scenario-specific planning metrics."

    "* highly interactive scenes with traffic participants (e.g. tailgating, high-velocity overtakes, double parked cars, jaywalking)\n",

    "A planning policy consumes a set of episodic observations and encodes them through a deep neural network to regress a future trajectory.\n",

    "The trajectory consists of a set of discrete future states (position, heading and velocity) sampled at fixed intervals which express the likelihood of the vehicle being at that state in the future.<br />\n",
    "For example, a predicted trajectory may consist of 10 future poses sampled at intervals of 0.5s across a 5s horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The policy is trained to maximize a set of aggregated objectives such as imitation, collision avoidance, traffic rule violation etc.<br />\n",
    "Imitation is the core training objective which indicates how close the predicted trajectory is to the expert ground truth and penalizes model predictions that deviate in space and time from the demonstration."
